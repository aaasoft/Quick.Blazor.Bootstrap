"The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. Set in "
"Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier work, The "
"Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. The writing began in "
"1937, and was published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955. The Lord of the "
"Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million "
"copies sold.\\nThe book's title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark "
"Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings "
"of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of "
"Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent "
"of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following "
"the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits "
"Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin."
